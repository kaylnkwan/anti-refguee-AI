        "2.   A simple model makes iteration quick and easyâ€“we'll see that for the project of classifying a tweet based words and hashtags and punctuations, cleverly extracting all these features from the text will be important for our success. Using a model that trains and evaluates quickly is essential for rapid feature selection.\n",
        "3.   Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, logistic regression is interpretable. You may have heard in the past that one thing deep neural networks struggle with is interpretabilityâ€“when you are using these models to make predictions that affect people's wellbeing (e.g., sentencing decisions, predictive policing decisions), it becomes extremely important that you are able to understand why a model is making the predictions it makes. For simpler models like logistic regression, we get interpretability for free! "
